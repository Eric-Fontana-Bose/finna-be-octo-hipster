A set of functions to enable setting the title and tab color of iTerm2 tabs.

Here's a screenshot of my daily terminal window. I have Rails server and
console running in the first 2 tabs, respectively; the PostgreSQL client
running against my Dev database in the next; the fourth tab is dedicated
to tests; the fifth tab is dedicated to Rake commands; the last tab is
for miscellaneous stuff:

In addition, there are 2 AppleScripts here that will
1. set up a series of iTerm tabs (7 in total), and change to your Rails directory
2. set the colors and titles of the iTerm tabs to my defaults

If you copy these AppleScripts to your ~/Library/Scripts directory they
will be available to you in the Scripts menu. If the Scripts menu is not
in your menu bar yet, you can enable it by opening
"/Applications/Utilities/AppleScript Editor.app", go to preferences, and
select "Show Script menu in menu bar".
